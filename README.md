# FRAUD-DETECTION-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD
I created a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze fraudulent transactions within the dataset. The report provides interactive visuals and key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify patterns, track fraudulent activities, and explore transaction behaviors across multiple dimensions.
## Project Objectives:

The main goal of this project was to design a Power BI dashboard that provides clear insights into fraudulent transactions within a dataset. Specifically, the objectives were:
	•	To identify and quantify fraudulent activities.
	•	To create key performance indicators (KPIs) that summarize the scale of fraud.
	•	To explore fraud patterns across multiple dimensions (e.g., city, payment method, device used).
	•	To build an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and drill down into details for further investigation.
